Hosted Website Link : - https://contact-list-react-app-f85d1.web.app/

This is a frontend implementation of a ContactList application built using React, where we can create, edit and delete contacts.

Features :-

- Fetching and showing users from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

- Add a contact, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the contact in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add contacts to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).

- Update a contact, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).

- Delete a contact, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
